# Binary-Tree
In computer science, a Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (L, S, R).This repository contains code on Binary-Tree, the tricks and techniques involved.

This repo included the python approaches as well.
